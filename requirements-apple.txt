# ============================================
# Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Specific
# ============================================

# CoreML for Apple Neural Engine
coremltools>=7.0.0

# MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) optimizations
# Already included in PyTorch - no extra package needed

# Note: For best performance on Apple Silicon:
# - Use device='mps' in PyTorch
# - Export to CoreML for production deployment
# - Batch size 8-16 works well on M3 Pro (18GB RAM)
